          <h3 class="strong">Airport</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            Cape Town only has one airport (code CPT), which is modern and reliable. There is one international terminal, with access to SIM cards, ATMs, and rideshare. We recommend Ubering to your housing.
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Arrival and departure dates</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            We'd of course love to host you as long as you can possibly stay! We are both taking the full week of the wedding (February 11-19) off of work so we can spend as much time as possible with our guests. When planning your dates, however, you should note that Wednesday, February 15 is reserved for brides-side/grooms-side days (our version of a bachelor/bachelorette party), and the official wedding is February 16-19. So arrive in time to overcome jetlag, and perhaps get some personal sight-seeing in before or after. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We anticipate that directly after the wedding we will be tired and/or on our honeymoon, so please don't plan to see much of us then.
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Visas</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            <a href="http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/immigration-services/exempt-countries" class="text-reset" target="_blank" class="b">Citizens of these countries</a>
            can get a 90-day visitors visa on arrival (check the "ordinary" column). Otherwise, you may have to apply—we can help you with documents.
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">SIM card</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            Data is cheap in South Africa, and we recommend you get a local SIM card if you don’t have easy access to international roaming. <b>Vodacom</b> is best: the SIM itself should cost R25 (appx $1), and data is about R150 ($8) / GB. They also have an app where you can check usage and reload. There is a Vodacom shop at the airport where you can purchase. <b>MTN</b> is also a good option if you prefer their yellow branding. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Cash & payments</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            Virtually all shops let you swipe or tap Visa or Mastercard (usually not Discover or Amex). We recommend setting up Google/Apple Pay—we make ~95% of payments like this. We recommend drawing <b>R500</b> in cash at the airport for emergencies or if you see something cute being sold by a street vendor. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Local transport</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            There have been disputes between Uber and its drivers, so the regular Uber service can be unreliable for shorter trips (drivers will accept your request, then wait for you to cancel to get the fee). We recommend using Uber Black by default, which is still relatively affordable. Please be diligent with checking license plates and paying attention during the ride to ensure you are on the intended path.
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Paying at restaurants</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            South Africa’s default tip is 10% for good service. Wait staff are generally grossly underpaid, however, so we recommend going with 20% if you can :) More importantly, <b>never</b> give your phone/card away when paying: the waiter should bring the card machine to your table. You should tell the waiter the total charge they should put on your card before you pay, which is the bill + the tip you intend to give.
          </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8">
              <h3 class="strong">Plugs</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
                Plugs: South Africa uses two types of plugs: one bizarre large round three prong that nobody else uses, and the normal European round two prong. Most plug points should have both, but you can buy a “double adaptor” once you arrive to convert three to two prong.
              </p>

          </div>

          <h3 class="strong">Loadshedding</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            Due to a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capture#:~:text=South%20African%20opposition%20parties%20have,influence%20the%20running%20of%20government." class="text-reset" target="_blank">State Capture</a>, many of South Africa's national companies, including its electricity company Eskom, are facing financial troubles. This has led to a shortage of power, and a schedule of rolling blackouts throughout the day. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Somewhat confusingly, the schedule changes week to week (and sometimes even in the middle of the day), but there is a great app called <a href="https://sepush.co.za/" class="text-reset" target="_blank">EskomSePush</a> which will clarify the schedule based on your location and notify you when power is scheduled to be cut.
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Water</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            You may have heard that several years ago, Cape Town was facing severe water shortages. This has all but passed in recent years, and our dams our now relatively full. South Africa is still a water scarce country, however, so we still encourage you to not be wasteful of tap water—which is perfectly safe and delicious to drink!
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Safety</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black">
            If you do some research online, you'll see that South Africa has some alarming crime stats. Much of the violent crime is concentrated in neighborhoods where tourists rarely go, and there is no need for fear while walking the streets during the day. The biggest risk for you is pickpocketing and other petty crime. Our safety recommendations are:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-black fs-5 mb-6">
            <li>Do not walk at night alone.</li>
            <li>Leave your passport at home, and only take what you need with you (especially if you’re partying).</li>
            <li>Keep your valuables in your front pockets, or ideally zipped up in a purse or bag.</li>
            <li>Don't leave your belongings unattended or look away from them.</li>
            <li>If you rent a car, always check your door after locking. Remote jamming is common. </li>
            <li>Do not buy drugs from strangers, especially in the street.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="strong">Renting a car</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            It is easiest to drive yourself to the wedding venue as it is too far away for an Uber, so you may wish to hire a car as a group just for the weekend. This will also give you the freedom to drive around the farm (walking distances can be up to a couple of kilometers), and to visit the nearby town of Greyton to shop. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Cars by default are manual transmission, so make sure to check that your rental is automatic if you can’t drive stick. A driver’s license from most wealthy nations will work here (Rafi still uses his US license). The biggest challenge will be learning to drive on the other side of the street—we are happy to help with some lessons if you are nervous! It is surprisingly easy to pick up, however.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are filling up with gas (or as we call it, petrol, which makes sense since it is not a gas), an attendant will come to your car and fill up for you. They will also kindly wash your windows, fill up your tires, and check your oil and windshield wiper fluid levels. Be sure to leave a tip when you pay!
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Emergency info</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-black mb-6">
            National cell phone emergency number: <b>112</b>.
            <br>
            General emergency number: <b>10111</b>.

          <h3 class="strong">Holidaying</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-white mb-6">
            We know that many of you may be planning on seizing this opportunity to plan a South African holiday - this is a great idea! Cape Town itself has many activities to keep you entertained: hiking, beaching, penguins, and views! We will be doing some group activities the week before the wedding, but if you want to stay on and see more of the spectacular city we call home, let us know and we can make some recommendations. If you want to venture slightly further afield, below are some suggestions you might decide to explore, although there are many more options. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Kruger National Park (2 hour flight)</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-white mb-6">
            Hands down the best safari experience in the country. You can reach Kruger by flying into Skukuza (inside the park), Hoedspruit, Phalaborwa, or Mbombela. Once you arrive, we recommend you hire a car and do a self-driving safari because a) the roads in the park have a speed limit of 40km/hr and are very easy to drive, and b) you can do as many game drives as you want whenever you want. You can book self-catering accommodation through the <a href="https://www.sanparks.org/reservations/accommodation/filters" class="text-reset" target="_blank">SANParks website</a>. In February, we recommend booking camp(s) in the South and Middle of the park (Skukuza, Lower Sabie, Olifants, Satara), as these will have the best game viewing.  While in the park, you can also book guided game drives (including sunrise and night drives) at the camp reception. At each camp there is a restaurant and shop to buy groceries. If you would prefer to book a fully guided safari experience, there are many on offer at a variety of price points (e.g. <a href="https://wild-wings-safaris.com/tours-and-safaris-to/south-africa" class="text-reset" target="_blank">here</a>). Normally these include airport pick up/drop off, accommodation, meals, and guided game drives. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">The Garden Route (6 hour drive)</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-white mb-6">
            Road tripping along the East Coast of South Africa is fantastic. We recommend hiring a car (although tourist transit options are available) and driving yourself. There are several lovely seaside and forest locations to visit along the way. Our favorites are:
            <a href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/garden_route/camps/wilderness/" class="text-reset" target="_blank">Wilderness</a>,
            <a href="https://www.wildspiritlodge.co.za/" class="text-reset" target="_blank">Nature's Valley</a>,
            <a href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/addo/" class="text-reset" target="_blank">Addo Elephant Park</a>.
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Nearby Getaways (1-3 hour drive)</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-white mb-6">
            Our favourite hiking and river swimming spot is
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kogelberg+palmiet+river&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiS5tbN8ND6AhV2g84BHW3NBToQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=kogelberg+palmiet+river&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJzoHCAAQgAQQGFDeAlibCWDACmgAcAB4AoABpwOIAYUOkgEHMi0zLjIuMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&sclient=img&ei=C45BY9K0OfaGur4P7ZqX0AM&bih=758&biw=1512" class="text-reset" target="_blank">Kogelberg Nature Reserve</a>, 

            which has self-catering <a href="https://www.capenature.co.za/reserves/kogelberg-nature-reserve" class="text-reset" target="_blank">eco-cabins</a>,
            or you can get an airbnb in Betty’s Bay (the closest town). The <a href="https://www.cederberg.co.za/" class="text-reset" target="_blank">Cederberg</a> 
            also has some phenomenally beautiful hiking and climbing. It will be hot, bring a hat! There are also many other lovely places near Cape Town (see some examples <a href="https://insideguide.co.za/cape-town/weekend-getaways/" class="text-reset" target="_blank">here</a>
            or <a href="http://tailsofamermaid.com/2020/08/south-african-getaways-covid19.html" class="text-reset" target="_blank">here</a>). 
          </p>

          <h3 class="strong">Wine Farms (30-90 min drive)</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-white mb-8">
            Cape Town and the surrounding area are full of beautiful wine farms. Most farms do wine tasting and sales, and have an excellent restaurant and beautiful scenery. You can visit the wine region for an afternoon or a few days. You might want to start your Google search with Stellenbosch, Franschoek, or Constantia.
